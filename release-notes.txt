SonarQube Sonargraph 8 Integration Plugin
=========================================

5.1.0
=====
- Custom metrics are now stored per system in individual properties files that need to be copied 
  to the SonarQube server.
- Fix false error message for not existing optional custom metrics properties file. 


5.0.0
=====
- Ensure compatibility with Sonargraph 9.14. The SonarQube plugin is now less tightly coupled to 
  changes in the XML report schema, reducing the number of necessary releases.  


4.1.2
=====
- Ensure compatibility with Sonargraph 9.13.0.


4.1.1
=====
- Reduce size of plugin by excluding external dependencies that are only needed 
  at build time or for tests.


4.1.0
=====
- Plugin is now compatible with new security policy that has been introduced with SonarQube 8.  


4.0.0
=====
- The plugin is now only executed once for the root project. This should speed up the processing significantly for larger projects.
- It supports Sonargraph 9.12 and higher.


3.1.1
=====
- Allow processing of a Sonargraph report that has been generated on a different machine.
  Configuration key "sonar.sonargraph.integration:system.basedir" can be used to specify 
  the absolute path of the parent directory of the XYZ.sonargraph directory. 
  This base directory will be used to resolve the relative root directories of the Sonargraph workspace.


3.1.0
=====
- Make the plugin executable with SonarQube 7.6. The officially supported plugin API version is 6.7.6.
  IMPORTANT: With SQ > 7.6 no metrics and issues are supported for directories anymore. 
  This information for those elements determined by Sonargraph is still available for SQ < 7.6.
- Make the plugin compatible with Sonargraph 9.10.


3.0.0
=====
- Use the newest integration access library (3.2.1) that allows executing
  the plugin on Java 11 runtime.


2.1.7
=====
- Use the newest integration access library (3.1.10).
- Updated built-in meta file containing metric and issue information.


2.1.6
=====
- Updated built-in meta file containing metric and issue information.
- Use the newest integration access library (3.1.9).
- Ignore system setup related issues (only report them in the console).
- Now plugin issues (issues created by installed Sonargraph plugins) are supported, they are
  activated (or deactivated) with the single rule 'Sonargraph Integration: Plugin Issue'.
- FIXED: Now script based issues also work for directories and source files (when the rule
  'Sonargraph Integration: Script Issue' is activated).


2.1.5
=====
- Now the SonarQube API 6.7.3 is used.
- Removed a lot of usages of deprecated API classes/methods.
- Updated built-in meta file containing metric and issue information.
- Contains a built-in quality profile.
- Project and module now show issues.
- There is no need to specify an user-defined meta file to cover script-based issue and metrics: 
  - Script issues are now activated (or deactivated) with the single rule 'Sonargraph Integration: Script Issue'.
  - Script metrics are now stored in a properties file and are automatically considered after a restart of 
    the SonarQube server. The properties file is stored at '.sonargraphintegration/metrics.properties'.
    NOTE: When introducing script metrics for the first time a warning message is created when it is 
          necessary to restart the SonarQube server because of a modified metrics.properties file.


2.1.4
=====
- Updated meta file containing metric and issue ids (added relational cohesion metric).


2.1.3
=====
- Adapted to use integration-access 3.1.5.


2.1.2
=====
- Now issues are added to directories and namespaces (which can be mapped to directories).


2.1.1
=====
- Issues having resolutions additionally show all resolution info (assignee, priority, description).


2.1.0
=====
- Now the original location of a refactored element is used to add refactoring definitions.
- Fix tasks are now available are rule.
- Resolutions in general are supported.
